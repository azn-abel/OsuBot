# OsuBot
A basic Discord bot for displaying recent and overall osu! scores. The aim of this bot is to provide a way for casual osu! players to share their accomplishments with each other. Commands and other features will be added upon request, and as I see fit. Basic documentation for this bot can be found below, and detailed documentation will be added to the [wiki page](https://github.com/azn-abel/OsuBot/wiki) once it is ready. Hope you enjoy!

Add this bot to your Discord server: [Click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=843169608852570184&permissions=534723816512&scope=bot)

## Basic Commands
Using ```>i [username]``` will return and display the cumulative stats of the specified user:

Using ```>r [username]``` or ```>t [username]```displays the specified user's most recent play or highest pp play.
This is useful for sharing accomplishments to members of a Discord server as they happen in real time.

Adding a ```-d``` clause to the above will provide a more detailed response that covers the users top 5 most recent scores or highest pp plays.
